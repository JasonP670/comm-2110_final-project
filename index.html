        </h2> 
        <div class="offset-sm-1">
          <p class="fs-4">Make sure to set aside time each day or week to talk and connect with your partner. This can be as simple as having a daily check-in conversation, or it can be a longer, more in-depth conversation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="fs-3">
          <a href="article-actively-listening.html">Listen actively:</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="offset-sm-1">
          <p class="fs-4"> When your partner is speaking, make an effort to really listen and understand what they are saying. Put aside distractions, make eye contact, and give them your full attention.</p>
        </div>

        </h2>
        <div class="offset-sm-1">
          <p class="fs-4"> Be open and honest with your partner about your thoughts, feelings, and needs. Don't be afraid to express yourself, even if it might be difficult or uncomfortable.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="fs-3">
          <a href="article-ask-questions.html">Ask questions:</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="offset-sm-1">
          <p class="fs-4"> If you don't understand something your partner is saying, or if you want to know more, ask questions. This can help to clarify misunderstandings and ensure that you and your partner are on the same page.</p>
